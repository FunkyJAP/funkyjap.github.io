# Implementation Plan: Frieren Charm Edition (The "Ecchi" Log)

## Concept
A playful spin-off of the AI/DS Journey Log. While maintaining the high-quality Frieren aesthetic, this version adds the "useless but charming" magic from the series, specifically referencing the "Sexual Charm" scene.

## Key Humorous Elements
1. **The "Failed Kiss" Interaction**: A clickable Frieren-style emote or button that triggers a "blowing kiss" effect, followed by a Fern-style reaction ("Ecchi-desu").
2. **Useless Spells for Data Science**:
    *   **Magic to see through clothes**: Reimagined as "Magic to see through Black Box Models" (Explainable AI).
    *   **Magic to make grapes sweet**: Reimagined as "Magic to make Loss functions look better".
    *   **Mimic Detection**: Reimagined as "Bug detection in Jupyter Notebooks".
3. **Fern's Gaze Overlay**: A subtle UI feedback when the user does something "improper" (like hovering too long on a specific section), triggering a "Trash-looking eyes" effect.

## Aesthetic Refinements
- **Primary Color**: A slightly warmer palette, leaning into the "twilight" or "sunset" feel.
- **Micro-interactions**: More dynamic reactions to clicks and hovers.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Base structure with the humor sections.
- `styles.css`: Styles for the "Ecchi" effects and premium layout.
- `script.js`: Logic for the kiss animation and Fern's pop-ups.
